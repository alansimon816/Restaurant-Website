## Description
This is a web site built for an imaginary restaurant. 

## What I Learned
This project served as an introduction to the use of NPM for managing packages
as well as the use of webpack for bundling JS modules. JS Modules were explored and utilized thoroughly. A major point of emphasis with this project was to build most of the
website via DOM manipulation facilitated by JS. I learned how to make a static navigation bar and a static footer. I also experimented with aesthetic design via button animations and windowed scrolling. I will likely come back to this to implement an ordering system.
