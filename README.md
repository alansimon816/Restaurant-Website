# [Restaurant-Website](https://alansimon816.github.io/Restaurant-Website/)

This is a web site built for an imaginary restaurant. This project served as an introduction to the use of NPM for managing packages
as well as the use of webpack for bundling JS modules. JS Modules were explored and utilized thoroughly. A major point of empahsis with this project was to build most of the
website via DOM manipulation through JS versus manual HTML coding.
